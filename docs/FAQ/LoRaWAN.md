# Frequently Asked Questions about LoRaWAN

<br></br>

<details> <summary>What is a LoRaWAN tracker?</summary>
A LoRaWAN tracker is a device that uses the LoRaWAN network to transmit location and sensor data. It is designed to track assets, vehicles, or individuals both indoors and outdoors. </details>

<details> <summary>How does a LoRaWAN tracker work?</summary>
A LoRaWAN tracker uses low-power, long-range communication technology called LoRaWAN to connect to a network of gateways. It periodically sends location and sensor data to the network, allowing users to track and monitor the device in real-time. </details>

<details> <summary>What are the advantages of using a LoRaWAN tracker?</summary>
LoRaWAN trackers offer several advantages, such as long battery life, wide coverage range, and low data transmission costs. They can operate both indoors and outdoors, making them suitable for various tracking applications. </details>

<details> <summary>What kind of assets can be tracked with a LoRaWAN tracker?</summary>
LoRaWAN trackers can be used to track a wide range of assets, including but not limited to vehicles, containers, machinery, equipment, pets, and even people. They provide real-time location information for efficient management and monitoring. </details>

<details> <summary>How accurate are LoRaWAN trackers in determining the location?</summary>
The accuracy of LoRaWAN trackers depends on several factors, including the number and density of gateways in the network, the environment (indoor or outdoor), and the specific tracker model. In outdoor environments with a high density of gateways, location accuracy can be within a few meters. </details>

<details> <summary>Do LoRaWAN trackers work indoors?</summary>
Yes, LoRaWAN trackers can work indoors, but the signal propagation and coverage may be affected by the physical structures and materials present in the building. In some cases, additional gateways or signal repeaters may be required to ensure consistent indoor coverage. </details>

<details> <summary>Can I customize the tracking settings on a LoRaWAN tracker?</summary>
Yes, most LoRaWAN tracker solutions offer customization options. You can typically configure parameters such as tracking intervals, movement thresholds, geofencing rules, and sensor measurements to fit your specific tracking requirements. </details>

<details> <summary>How long does the battery of a LoRaWAN tracker last?</summary>
The battery life of a LoRaWAN tracker depends on factors such as the tracking interval, the frequency of data transmission, and the power-saving features of the device. However, LoRaWAN trackers are designed for long battery life and can typically operate for several months to years without needing a battery replacement. </details>

<details> <summary>Can I integrate the data from a LoRaWAN tracker with other systems?</summary>
Yes, LoRaWAN trackers usually provide APIs or integration options to connect with various software platforms or systems. This allows you to leverage the data from the tracker in your existing applications for analytics, reporting, and visualization. </details>

<details> <summary>Is a LoRaWAN network required for using LoRaWAN trackers?</summary>
Yes, a LoRaWAN tracker requires a LoRaWAN network infrastructure to operate. This includes gateways that receive and relay the tracker's data to a network server. You can either set up your own private LoRaWAN network or use a public LoRaWAN network provided by a third-party provider. </details>
