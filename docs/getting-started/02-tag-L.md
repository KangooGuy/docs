## Troubleshooting

In the event that the device fails to join, consider the following list of workarounds:

#### 1. Check your LoRaWAN coverage.
If applicable, plug in your LoRaWAN Gateway. In case you have your own network server, check on there if data is coming through.

#### 2. Check if battery is fully charged: 
Try charging it with a standard USB-C cable and try again from step 2.

#### 3. Submit a ticket to the truvami team, and we will provide support as promptly as possible.
