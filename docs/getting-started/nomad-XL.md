## Troubleshooting

In the event that the device fails to join, consider the following list of workarounds:

#### 1. Check your LoRaWAN coverage.
If applicable, plug in your LoRaWAN Gateway. In case you have your own network server, check on there if data is coming through.

#### 2. Reset the device using the magnet: 
Hold the magnet against the front side of the housing for at least 10 seconds. The device should restart, accompanied by the truvami startup melody. If the melody plays but the device remains unjoined, repeat the claim process outlined in the getting started guide. If the startup melody does not play, proceed to step 2.

#### 3. Submit a ticket to the truvami team, and we will provide support as promptly as possible. 
In order to do so, write an email to our technical support team: hey@truvami.com
