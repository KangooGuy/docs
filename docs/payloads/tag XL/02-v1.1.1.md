### Configurable Parameters - Device Defaults and Parameter Limits

All listed parameters **must** be stored in the NVM. All adjusted values through downlinks must remain the same 
after a device reset or power down.

### GNSS-NG Localization Message

A GNSS-NG localization message is sent on port 192 (see [Modem Service Protocol Payloads](https://www.loracloud.com/documentation/modem_services?url=mdmsvc.html#modem-service-protocol-payloads)). One or more of these messages are sent after a successful GNSS-NG scan. They are generated by the Semtech's geolocation middleware. Please read the [documentation of the geolocation middleware](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWSD004/blob/v1.3.0/geolocation_middleware/doc/geolocationMiddleware.rst) for more information.

### Wi-Fi Localization Message

A Wi-Fi localization message is sent on port 197 (see [Modem Service Protocol Payloads](https://www.loracloud.com/documentation/modem_services?url=mdmsvc.html#modem-service-protocol-payloads)). This message is sent after a successful Wi-Fi scan. It is generated by the Semtech's geolocation middleware. Please read the [documentation of the geolocation middleware](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWSD004/blob/v1.3.0/geolocation_middleware/doc/geolocationMiddleware.rst) for more information.

### <b>Message Usage</b>

### Welcome Messages

A welcome message is sent every time the device successfully joined to a LoRaWAN network (unconfirmed). It corresponds to a settings uplink for the tags `[0x40, 0x41, 0x42, 0x43, 0x44, 0x45, 0x46]`. Therefore, it contains all settings of the device including the battery voltage and the firmware hash.

### Heartbeat Messages

A heartbeat message is sent at a fixed interval (unconfirmed). The HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL is stored in the settings. A heartbeat message corresponds to a settings uplink for the tag `0x45`. Therefore, it only contains the battery voltage. If the HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL is adjusted via a settings downlink, a heartbeat message is sent immediately and the new interval is used for the next heartbeat message.

### Settings Messages

For every received setting downlink, the device takes the actions for the received commands and sends a **confirmed** settings uplink. The actions are summarized in the following list:

- Setter command: Is used to change the value of a setting. First, the range of the value is checked. If the value is in the valid range, it is stored in NVM. The current value of the setting is added to the settings uplink.
- Getter command: Is used to read the value of a setting. The current value of the setting is added to the settings uplink.
- Runner command: Is used to execute an action with the given runner settings. The applied runner settings are added to the settings uplink.

The settings uplink uses the same order of settings as the commands of downlink that it received before. For example, if the received downlink contains the commands with tags `[0x22, 0x20, 0x44, 0x80]`, the uplink will contain the settings with tags `[0x42, 0x40, 0x44, 0x80]`. The value of the settings correspond to the value of the **applied** settings. If one of the commands in the downlink tried to set a setting to a value out of range, the corresponding setting will not be changed. Hence, the settings uplink will contain the last value that was applied successfully instead of the value that was requested by the downlink.

### Settings Messages with Alarm Command

If a setting downlink contains the alarm runner command `0x80` an alarm with the specified duration and interval is started. The parameters are stored in RAM, not in NVM. The device exits the alarm mode after the specified duration has elapsed. A running alarm is stopped if an alarm downlink is received with either duration or interval set to 0 (or both). As for other settings downlinks, the device sends a **confirmed** settings uplink after a downlink with alarm runner command. The uplink confirms the duration and interval that were used to start or stop the alarm.

### Settings Downlink

A settings downlink is sent on port 151. The
